# @figlet-ts/fonts

A library of ASCII fonts (FLF-format) for use with [@figlet-ts/lib](../lib/README.md)

Use it for:

-   Embedding 15KB of the specific font you want in your lean, mean, brotlified, minified source code
-   Embedding 11MB of text files to bloat your app because you forgot to make your bundler do tree-shaking

## Installation

You will likely want this installed as a dev dependency, so you can use a bundler to cherry-pick / tree-shake the subset of fonts that you want.

**NOTE**: you don't **need** this fonts library to be able to use figlet-ts. The simplest implementation is to just embed a FLF font file (it's plain text) somewhere in your assets path, and use [@figlet-ts/lib](../lib/README.md) to load the FLF file directly.

This fonts bundle just makes things a little easier.

```bash
# npm
npm install -D @figlet-ts/fonts    # Install this fonts library as dev-dependency
npm install @figlet-ts/lib   # Install figlet-ts library to use the fonts in your app

# yarn
yarn add --dev @figlet-ts/fonts    # Install this fonts library as
yarn add @figlet-ts/lib      # Install figlet-ts library to be able to use the fonts in your app
```

## Usage - Server-Side

```ts
// index.ts
```

## Usage - Vue.js

```ts
// component.vue
```

# Goals
